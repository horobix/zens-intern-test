  'A teacher was explaining to her class how evolution worked. She said, "First, there were single-celled organisms, and then they evolved into more complex organisms, until finally, humans evolved."

The other scientist disagreed, saying, "I think life started on land, with plants and animals evolving from a common ancestor." They continued to debate until finally, a third scientist chimed in and said, "Actually, life started when the aliens came and planted us here." The other two scientists laughed, but the third one said, "No, I\'m serious. I read it on the internet."',
  'A group of friends were discussing religion and evolution. One person said, "I believe that God created the world and everything in it."

The fourth person said, "I believe that we\'re all just characters in a simulation." The others looked at him in confusion, and he added, "What? It makes more sense than any of the other theories!"',

The man said, "Wow, that sounds so simple and peaceful." The grandfather responded, "Yes, it was a simpler time, but we also had to work much harder just to survive." The man thought for a moment and then asked, "So, which one is better?" The grandfather smiled and said, "That\'s for you to decide."',
  'A man visited a zoo and stopped at the primate exhibit. He noticed that one of the monkeys seemed to be staring at him intently.

"Can I ask you a question?" The man was shocked and replied, "Uh, sure." The monkey continued, "Do you believe in evolution?" The man thought for a moment and then said, "Yes, I do." The monkey nodded and said, "Good. Because I\'m trying to convince these other monkeys that we didn\'t just magically appear here."',
